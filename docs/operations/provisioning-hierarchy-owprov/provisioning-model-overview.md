title: Provisioning Model Overview
---

Provision devices using a shared configuration hierarchy (Entity -> Venue -> Subscriber) instead of configuring each device manually.

Core concepts and design philosophy:

- Use hierarchy for scale and repeatability.
- Apply shared templates at higher levels and targeted overrides at lower levels.
- Keep workflows consistent across Entities, Venues, and Devices.
