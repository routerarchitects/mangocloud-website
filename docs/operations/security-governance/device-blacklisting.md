title: Device Blacklisting
---

Use case: Block stolen/lost or unauthorized devices (unknown serial numbers) from reconnecting or being onboarded. Once blacklisted, OWGW treats the device as restricted and blocks its connection and provisioning under that controller.

Steps:

1. Log in to OWGW-UI.
2. Go to Devices -> Blacklist.
