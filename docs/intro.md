# MangoCloud Overview

MangoCloud is an open-source, production-ready controller for OpenWiFi Access Points, Switches, and OpenLAN Gateways (OLGs). Maintained by Router Architects, the project provides multi-tenant automation, telemetry, and APIs aligned with service-provider requirements.

## Why MangoCloud

- **Open-source governance:** Transparent roadmap, CLA-backed contributions, and permissive licensing.
- **Production hardened:** Multi-tenant controls, compliance-aligned operations, and high availability tooling.
- **Hardware coverage:** First-class support for the entire OpenWiFi ecosystem with consistent telemetry and policy models.

## Architecture Pillars

1. **Cloud-native design** — Stateless microservices, container packaging, and GitOps-friendly manifests.
2. **Security first** — Role-based access, encrypted control channels, and auditable workflows.
3. **API-first integrations** — REST, gRPC, and event streaming to connect OSS/BSS platforms.

## Continue Learning

- Follow the [Getting Started guide](/docs/intro/getting-started) to deploy MangoCloud.
- Review the [Architecture documentation](/docs/architecture/system-architecture) to understand service boundaries.
