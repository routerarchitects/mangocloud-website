# Deploy with Docker Compose

Docker Compose is ideal for local testing, demos, or small PoCs.

## Requirements

- Docker Engine 24+
- Docker Compose plugin
- 16GB RAM recommended

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RouterArchitects/mangocloud-website mangocloud
cd mangocloud/deploy
cp docker-compose.example.yml docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

## Configuration

- Set environment variables for database credentials, message bus URLs, and JWT secrets.
- Update the `controller` service with your ingress hostname.
- Enable volume mounts for persistent telemetry data if needed.

## Verification

Use `docker compose ps` to confirm all services are healthy, then navigate to the web UI using the hostname configured above. Onboarding workflows are identical to the Kubernetes deployment.
