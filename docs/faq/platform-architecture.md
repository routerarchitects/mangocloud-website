# Platform & Architecture

### How is Mango Cloud related to the openLAN project?

Mango Cloud is built on the OpenWiFi Cloud SDK and serves as the cloud management platform for all openLAN-compliant devices. It provisions, configures, and monitors OpenWiFi access points, openLAN switches, and openLAN gateways through a unified cloud control plane.

By leveraging the OpenWiFi Cloud SDK, Mango Cloud provides consistent onboarding, policy management, telemetry, and multi-tenant operations across wired and wireless openLAN infrastructure.

**What Mango Cloud is not:**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To set expectations clearly:

- Mango Cloud is not embedded in the switch hardware.
- openLAN can, in principle, be adapted to other controllers.
- Mango Cloud does not replace traditional data-center switch controllers.
- Its focus is access-layer LAN and Wi-Fi operations, not core switching.
