# Architecture Overview

MangoCloud is composed of modular services that communicate over event-driven APIs. Each region hosts stateless control planes backed by persistent data services.

## Core Layers

1. **Ingress & API Gateway** — Terminates TLS, authenticates tenants, and routes REST/gRPC requests.
2. **Control Plane** — Scheduler, workflow engine, and policy compiler responsible for orchestrating device behavior.
3. **Data Plane** — Telemetry ingestion, time-series storage, and analytics exporters.
4. **Device Adapters** — OpenWiFi-specific adapters managing AP, Switch, and OLG lifecycles.

## Platform Characteristics

- Multi-region ready with etcd/PostgreSQL HA primitives
- Stateless microservices with horizontal scaling
- Event streaming between onboarding, configuration, and telemetry services

Refer to `/docs/architecture/system-architecture` for deployment diagrams and `/docs/architecture/services-overview` for component responsibilities.
