# Security

Security is foundational for a multi-tenant OpenWiFi controller. MangoCloud follows secure SDLC practices, infrastructure hardening, and responsible disclosure.

## Principles

- Defense-in-depth across control planes, data planes, and APIs
- Least privilege RBAC aligned to tenants and operators
- Continuous dependency scanning and image signing

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

1. Email `security@routerarchitects.com` with an encrypted report (PGP key published in the repository).
2. Include reproduction steps, impact, and any mitigation ideas.
3. Expect an acknowledgement within 48 hours and triage timeline within five business days.

Please do not open public GitHub issues for security findings.

## Hardening Guidance

- Run controller components on dedicated clusters with network segmentation.
- Use provided manifests to enable TLS everywhere and enforce strong cipher suites.
- Rotate API keys and tenant secrets regularly; automation examples are included in `/docs/configuration/config-profiles`.
