# MangoCloud Roadmap

MangoCloud tracks deliverables publicly to keep the OpenWiFi ecosystem aligned on priorities. Releases follow semantic versioning with LTS indicators when features reach production-readiness for ISPs.

## v0.x – Core Services (In Progress)

- Stabilize authentication, policy, and device control loops
- Deliver reference Kubernetes and Docker Compose deployments
- Publish hardware compatibility data and golden onboarding flows

## v1.0 – Production Hardening (Planned)

- Multi-cluster coordination and zero-downtime upgrades
- SOC 2 aligned operational runbooks and observability packs
- Tenant-level resource quotas and delegated administration

## Beyond v1.0 – Analytics & Automation (Future)

- Analytics pipeline with actionable insights for APs, switches, and OLGs
- Closed-loop automation for firmware rollouts and policy remediation
- Ecosystem integrations (OSS/BSS, observability vendors, infrastructure APIs)

## How to Contribute

- Join [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/RouterArchitects/mangocloud-community/discussions) for roadmap proposals
