# MangoCloud Roadmap

MangoCloud tracks deliverables publicly to keep the OpenLAN ecosystem aligned on priorities. Releases follow semantic versioning with LTS indicators when features reach production-readiness for ISPs.

## v1.0 – Residential WiFi (In Progress)

> **Scope:** Enable full residential WiFi support with subscriber self-service, improved UI/UX, and backend scalability.

- Residential WiFi support across cloud, gateway, and application layers
- Subscriber Mobile Application v1: self-onboarding, SSID and password management for private and guest WiFi, mesh node management, connected device view, pause/resume internet per device, and topology view
- OWGW UI enhancements with structured UI-based OpenWiFi AP configuration, removing raw JSON dependency
- Major Self-Care portal changes to support residential subscribers and mobile application integration
- OWProv enhancements for subscriber-aware provisioning and lifecycle management
- Introduction of a new topology service written in Go for real-time topology visibility
- Scalability support for up to 50,000 simultaneous connections

## v2.0 – MDU & Large-Scale Deployment (Planned)

> **Scope:** Extend Mango WiFi Cloud to support MDUs, large-scale ISP deployments, and advanced service integrations.

- Integration of OWGW service with CGW service for unified gateway and subscriber management
- Horizontal scalability support for up to 500,000 devices
- UI blocks for configuration and management of OpenLAN switches and gateways
- New API services for MDU onboarding and unit-level operations
- Enhanced user and role management to support MDU hierarchies
- MDU subscriber onboarding via the subscriber mobile application
- Scheduled internet blocking feature available in the subscriber mobile application

## Beyond v2.0 – Analytics & Automation (Future)

- Analytics pipeline with actionable insights for OpenWiFi Access Points, OpenLAN Switches, and OpenLAN Gateways
- Closed-loop automation for firmware rollouts and policy remediation
- Ecosystem integrations (OSS/BSS, observability vendors, infrastructure APIs)
